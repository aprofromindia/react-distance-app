# **React Native distance calculating app**

This is a cross platform React Native app (iOS/Android) that given 2 geo-coordinates as input would calculate and display the intervening distance between those 2 coordinates.

Please run the app using `npm run ios/android`.

- The app displays various advanced ES6/7 features including the *spread operators, instance variables, enhanced object literal notation, arrow functions* etc. 

- The app also uses various advanced React concepts like *Pure and Functional Components* etc.

- The app also displays various quirks of the current React native implementation, e.g. a ScrollView embedded TextInput for a more natural native Keyboard behaviour.

- We have also integrated flow.js for static type checking. 

- We also demonstrate some of the accessibility best practices for React Native.
